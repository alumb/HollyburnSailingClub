Hollyburn Sailing Club began operation in 1963 with the main objective of training North Shore children in seamanship. With the blessing of the District and the West Vancouver Parks and Recreation Commission the HSC has operated out of Ambleside Park for almost 50 years training over 10,000 individuals. Our training programs have expanded to include adult sailing and kayaking lessons.
Hollyburn sailors have achieved Olympic status, competed in numerous World Championships and raced in the America’s Cup.
The clubhouse is located on beautiful Ambleside Beach. A large deck and facilities are available for members and guests to enjoy.
The club supports participation across a wide range of non-powered boating activity, including sailing, kayaking, rowing and stand-up paddleboarding.
The main objectives of the club are as follows:
To provide the club’s members with training and instruction in the art and science of navigation, the operation of all manner of sailboats and kayaks, and to provide opportunities for self-development, leadership, and sportsmanship in the field of sailing/kayaking and its related activities.
To encourage the growth of the sport and the bringing together of people who are interested in sailing/kayaking.
To encourage the development of the sport of sailing/kayaking amongst the youth of the community.
To cooperate with other clubs, societies, and associations that have like objectives.
For members who do not own boats, the Co-op Program offers co-op members the use of a variety of club sailboats and kayaks.
All members are expected to be familiar with and abide by the HSC safety guidelines and use sound judgement and common sense on the water.
