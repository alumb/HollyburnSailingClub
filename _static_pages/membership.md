### New Members Welcome

Members of the executive and club members welcome you and your family and friends to Hollyburn Sailing Club. We hope you will enjoy many wonderful moments on the ocean in the watercraft of your choice, and on land by the seaside.
Over the course of the year we run races, social events and workshops which all are welcome to participate in. The club is open for your use any day of the year, and many sailors, kayakers, stand-up paddleboarders and rowboat enthusiasts continue to get out on the water during the winter months.
As a volunteer-based organization, we are always looking for help with race committee, social events, building maintenance, clean-up days and many other tasks.

### Social

In addition to the obvious activities of sailing and kayaking, the club also supports a wide range of social activities. These range from formal club-organised events to informal gatherings of friends and family at the beautifully-situated club-house.

The club hosts a number of musical events during the course of the year. Members may reserve the club-house for private functions as well (within the guidelines and rules of the club).
____
Although members are encouraged to participate in the club's water-based activities, this is not a requirement and many members belong solely for the social aspects afforded by the club.

Boat Storage spaces are assigned by the Rear Commodore, after application and payment have been processed by the Membership Director. New applicants will be advised of availability of boat storage space. Fees may be refunded if space does not become available by year-end. Boat ground storage space requires a launch dolly, as there is no room for road trailers. Members must always sign the log book to record their boat usage. Renewal applications for storage of inactive boats will not be processed and the Executive will require boat removal by the end of March.
Note that the club's insurance does not cover members' boats stored at the club. Members should ensure that their personal insurance covers any of their possessions stored at the club.
