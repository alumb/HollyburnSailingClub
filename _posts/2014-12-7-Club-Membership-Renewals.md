As you know, this past year was the club’s 50th anniversary. We still have some club swag left over from the celebrations and we
would like to use it to reward our members who renew their membership promptly. As we have already done at the December events,
we will be giving each member (and each family member for family memberships) an anniversary mug and T-shirt for all club dues
paid before 31st January. In order to claim your swag please note:
Swag will be handed out to paid-up members at the club, on 10th and 24th January.
Fees must be paid in full when collecting your swag. Please, no post-dated cheques.
If you have already paid your dues and haven’t claimed your swag, you qualify for the mug and T-shirt
I will be at the club from 09:00 to 10:00 on Saturday 10th and Saturday 24th January
