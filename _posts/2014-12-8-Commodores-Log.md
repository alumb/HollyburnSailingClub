The election of a new executive before the final issue of the Spreader is published for the year
is opportune, as it permits a unique opportunity to reflect on the closing year and envision the
new year.
Firstly, on behalf of the entire club, thank you to the previous executive for their dedication and
hard work. I have come to believe that only an executive member can truly appreciate the
number, diversity and scope of issues that must be addressed on a monthly and ongoing basis to
keep this club functioning. Commodore Morford and his team dealt with the typical, yet varied
club related issues such as the critical and demanding training program, allocation of our
limited boat storage spaces, the issue of appropriate vetting of prospective member applicants,
fleet upgrading, grant applications, special club events and operation of the Co-op. As well,
developing and maintaining an effective liaison with the municipality and managing the major
external issue of incorporating our club’s role into the new and ever evolving waterfront
development vision.
A critical lesson learned under Roy’s leadership is the importance of teamwork to the club.
Each executive member must take responsibility for their portfolio, but within the context of
working with the group. This will be even more critical as I support the growing trend of teams
even within a portfolio, as this will be a key factor in making the future executive positions
more accessible to our younger members who work and care for families. Indeed, teamwork is a lesson for all club members, as each
of us must be responsible for our actions regarding safety and club usage within the context of the Hollyburn community. Our club
membership is diverse in age, occupation, background and expectations, yet we all must work and play in harmony to thrive.
The 2015 executive enjoys a balance of previous members for continuity, as well as incoming members bringing new perspectives to
managing club business. But the entire executive will of necessity draw on the knowledge and experience of all club members to
successfully address the many challenges in the coming year.
