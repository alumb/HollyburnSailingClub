The Coop boats are owned by Holyburn Sailing Club and maintained by coop members. The club provides basic rigging and safety equipment. However, it is up to each coop member to provide their own properly fitting, regulation personal flotation devices (PFDs) for themselves and their family and guests, while using the club's co-op boats.
